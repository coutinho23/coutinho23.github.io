Interest in IT

During my high school years 6th standard to be precise we had Novell come our campus to explain a bit of what they do. I vaguely remember
not understanding anything however just the feeling to touching a computer keyboard and look at some lines of code got me really excited.
Thereafter and pretty much unknowingly I started to play a lot of computers most of times upgrading memory, copying data to 1.2mb floppy
drives and back. It soon took off when I was first exposed to Windows 3.0. My curiosity grew no bounds and very soon I knew my ways around 
most of hardware that was required to get a good computer working. I then installed my first video Game "Doom" and had a ball ever after.

Very soon I was bored and wanted to get more exposure to computers and specially www. I then got a temporary job as a data entry operator
for a crane manufacturing company. I would basically enter inventory of all purchases and sales into a company software. Thereon I moved
into Deskside support and loved it very much. I managed to complete my Bachelors in Commerce during this time. Curiosity being at all time
high my quest to learn and grow knew no bounds. As time moved on I was offered a system administrator role in Dubai where I enventually 
ended up working for 10 years doing Compute - server and systems administration across a vast range of Os and applications.

We then migrated to Australia for about 12 years ago and during this time I have worked for the RAC and Bankwest supporting their Compute 
and Storage platforms. As much as I like my current work I feel the world has evolved a fair bit and there is an enormous push for software
defined everything,Cloud  and systems automation. I felt the need to go back to the drawing board and get my basics in place to take on this
new world where everything runs on code.

So, here I am trying to wrap my head around a few programming languages and also trying to get a formal professional degree in Information 
technology. My choice of studying with RMIT was instantaneous mainly because of its course curriculum and also its professional rating as university. 
What I look to take away from my degree is a good grasp of one programming language and to help be build my logic when it comes to code. I plan
to use this mainly at my workplace to automated manual tasks and help me focus on keeping up with Technology
