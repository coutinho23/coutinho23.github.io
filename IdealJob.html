 series and IBM servers.  Additionally I have a solid background in VMware virtulisation and HyperV. On the Cloud side I support Ficon

game is to master how to deploy IaaS using code and also read/write data using APIs from vendors. So that I can use this data 
to better report on capacity and peformance utilisation
